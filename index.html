					<h1>A Moment In Time</h1>
					<h5>By: Jermielle Aaleahya U. Egay</h5>
				<h3>Salty sea spray kisses cheek</h3>
				<h3>Sunshine dreams make its peak</h3>
				<h3>To be young, wild, and free</h3>
				<h3>Is to have faces filled with glee</h3>	
				<h3>Every childhood is an enchanted place</h3>
				<h3>With nostalgic memories we can trace</h3>
				<h3>Precious moments spent like dime</h3>
				<h3>All slipped away into a moment in time</h3>
